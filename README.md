# 📚 Library Management System (Hibernate ORM)

A simple console-based Library Management System built in Java using Hibernate ORM. This project demonstrates object-relational mapping, entity relationships, and database operations (CRUD) using Hibernate — without the use of Spring Boot or other abstractions — to gain a deeper understanding of Hibernate’s core mechanisms.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was built as part of my personal learning journey into Java-based backend development. Specifically, I wanted to:

- Master Hibernate ORM by implementing real-world entity relationships (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.)
- Understand session management, transactions, and cascading in Hibernate
- Learn how Java classes translate into relational database tables
- Prepare myself for building more complex backend systems with Spring and microservices

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Add Authors and associate multiple Books with each Author
- Auto-persist related entities using cascading
- Understand and control Hibernate session and transaction lifecycles
- Basic PostgreSQL integration
- Clean domain-driven design for educational clarity

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Hibernate ORM 7.x
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA (for development)
